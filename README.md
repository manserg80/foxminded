https://foxminded.ua/front-end-1/

HTML-CSS section
I've learned the basics of editing and positioning HTML blocks with CSS based on the web page layout. Place elements using the float property, use placement of blocks based on Flex and Grid layouts, and implement complex user interfaces.

JavaScript section
This section is focused on working with variables, operators, data types, and functions. Interaction with DOM, strings and arrays. Object Oriented JavaScript. Extending and validating forms with JS. Refreshing web pages with AJAX. Storing data using Local and Session Storage and storing intermediate data using cookies.

React section
These tasks are aimed at developing a SPA application (app for selling bicycles, based on a pre-implemented layout) and applying the main techniques and philosophy of React: Building Core Components, Modules, Models, and Services with React. Types of data binding. Built-in directives. Events and Forms. Using and creating pipes (pipes). Components and their lifecycle. Services and their providers. Routing and navigation. Modules (creation and use) and such lazy loading. Asynchronous HTTP requests, using the RxJS library. Data storage using Firebase.
